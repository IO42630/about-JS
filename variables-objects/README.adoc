=== var vs let

==== scoping
`var` is scoped to the function body. +
`let` is scoped to the block.

==== hoisting
to hoist : hochheben, hissen. +
`var` is hoisted : initialized with `undefined` before the code is run. +
`let` is not hoisted : accessing before initialization `-> ReferenceError`.

==== global object property
At the top level, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object:

[source,js]
var foo = "Foo";  // globally scoped
let bar = "Bar"; // globally scoped
console.log(window.foo); // Foo
console.log(window.bar); // undefined

=== redeclaration
In `strict mode`, `var` allows redeclaration within the same scope, while `let` raises a `SyntaxError`.

[source,js]
'use strict';
var foo = "foo1";
var foo = "foo2"; // No problem, 'foo' is replaced.
let bar = "bar1";
let bar = "bar2"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'bar' has already been declared


=== reassignment
`const` behaves like `let` , except can't be reassigned.



=== 013 inheritance
In Javascript, there is no class inheritance. +
Instead, objects can inherit directly from other objects by setting `\\__proto__` property.
If a property can't be found within an object, JS will look in the object referenced by `\\__proto__`.

==== `new` keyword

1. Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object;
1. Links (sets the constructor of) this object to another object;
1. Passes the newly created object from Step 1 as the this context;
1. Returns this if the function doesn't return an object.



=== Objects
|===
| `var foo = {}` | empty object
| `var foo = "bar"` | simple value object
| `var foo = {type:"bar",color:"red"}` | multiple value object
|===

in JS abjects are Maps of properties.
