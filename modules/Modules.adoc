* used by Require.js

{empty} +

==== ES6
* clean syntax of CJS with async loading of ES6
* not yet supported by browsers
** a transpiler like Babel must be used

===== How to configure Babel
* Install babel `npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env` +
* Create a `.babelrc` file in project root (_Working directory:_) containing `{ "presets": ["env"] }` +
* Add _Node parameters_ and adjust path to _JavaScript file_ .
