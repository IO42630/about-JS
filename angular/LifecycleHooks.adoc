== Lifecycle Hooks

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| ngOnChanges |
triggers following the modification of @Input bound class members.
| ngOnInit |
fires once upon initialization of a component’s input-bound (@Input) properties
| ngDoCheck |
fires with every change detection cycle.
Angular runs change detection frequently.
Performing any action will cause it to cycle.
| ngAfterContentInit |
fires after the component’s content DOM initializes (loads for the first time)
| ngAfterContentChecked |
fires after every cycle of change detection targeting the content DOM
| ngAfterViewInit |
fires once after the view DOM finishes initializing
| ngAfterViewChecked |
fires after any change detection cycle targeting the component’s view
| ngOnDestroy |
fires upon a component’s removal from the view and subsequent DOM.
This hook provides a chance to clean up any loose ends before a component’s deletion.
