= Services
:toc:

==== About
* 3 services
** `Data` : just holds an `[]`
** `Logging` : prints it's identifier and some message
*** shows how `child` gets it's own instance because of override.
** `Relay` : holds an `EventEmitter`, through which messages can be passed between components

==== Injection
* Config:
- `@Injectable({providedIn: ...})` in Service
- `@NgModule({providers: ...})` in Module
- `@Component({providers: ...})` in Component
* Injection:
- the injection itself happens in the Component via `constructor` param.

==== Hierarchy / Availability
* services injected into an outer component are inherited to the nested component.
* if provide an inherited service again, it is overridden
** thus, a new instance is created and referenced (see `LoggingService`).

|===
| `providers` in  | available | injector used | usage

| `AppModule` | app-wide | root injector | default
| `AppComponent`,  | component tree, except services | component specific | if scoped
| `Component` | component tree | component specific | if scoped
| Eager-loaded Module | app-wide | root injector | avoid this
| Lazy-loaded Module | in loaded module | child injector | if scoped
|===

* dependencies of lazy-loaded modules become also lazy-loaded (-> new instance!!)

==== Magic Mock Web API
1. `InMemoryDbService.createDb()` defines some data store by returning `{xyz}`.
1. by including `HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule` in `app.module`, +
we mock an endpoint at the canonical URL `api/xyz`.
1. we can now use `HttpClient.get(api/xyz)`
