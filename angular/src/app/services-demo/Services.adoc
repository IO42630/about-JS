=== Injection

* configuration:
- `@Injectable({providedIn: ...})` in Service
- `@NgModule({providers: ...})` in Module
- `@Component({providers: ...})` in Component
* injection:
- the injection itself happens in the Component via `constructor` param.

=== Injection Hierarchy

* services injected into an outer component are inherited to the nested component.
* if provide an inherited service again, it is overridden
** thus, a new instance is created and referenced.
** see demo, where we have one `DataService` instance, and two `LoggingService` instances.
* this leads also to the following behaviour of services provided in:
** `AppModule` : available application-wide
** `AppComponent` : available to all components, but not services
** `Component` : available to component and children (if any).
