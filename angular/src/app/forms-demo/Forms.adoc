= Forms

===== Basic

* use `<form>`
- 'register' input by supplying `ngModel`
- name the input via `name='foo'`
* inside `<form>` a `<button>` with `type="submit"` will trigger form submission
- _ng_ taps into this by providing an `(ngSubmit)` on the `<form>`

===== NgForm

* set up via `#foo="ngForm"`
* `dirty` -> changed value
* `touched` -> clicked (without changing value)

===== NgModel

* as a *binding*:
- no binding (just register as a control) `<input ngModel>`
- one way `<input [ngModel]>`
- two-way `<input [(ngModel)]>`
* as a *reference*:
- set up via `#foo="ngModel"`

===== ngModelGroup

* adds ability to group form fields.
* as a *reference*:
- set up via `#foo="ngModel"`
