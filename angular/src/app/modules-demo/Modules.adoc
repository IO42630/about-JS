===== Eager Loading

* how to extract:
** extract into new `foo.module.ts`, import it.
*** the new `foo.module.ts` will naturally export some `FooComponent`
** link to that `FooComponent` in `app-routing.module.ts`
* see `selector-demo`.

===== Lazy Loading

* eager (default) -> load all modules on page visit
* lazy -> load only modules linked to current route
** feature module must provide it's own routes
