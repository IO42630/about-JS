==== Directives
* For definition of directive, see Html.adoc
* Angular adds 3 main types of directives.

===== Component Directives
* ~ Component (TS class && HTML template)
* embedded in parent html via directive `<app-messages></app-messages>`
** which corresponds to `selector: 'app-messages'` in TS class

===== Structural Directives
* are called with `*` prefix
* manipulate structure of the document
* e.g. `*ngIf` , `*ngFor`
* `*ngIf` does not 'hidden=true', removes from DOM altogether.

===== Attribute Directives
* are usually called with `[<directive>]`
* manipulate attributes of elements of the document
* e.g. `ngClass` , `ngStyle`
