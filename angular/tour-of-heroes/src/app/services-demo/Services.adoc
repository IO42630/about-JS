= Services

=== Injection Hierarchy

* used terms
** `[providers]=` determines where service is 'provided'.
** 'injection' is determined via `constructor` params
* services injected into an outer component are inherited to the nested component.
* if provide an inherited service again, it is overridden
** thus, a new instance is created and referenced.
** see demo, where we have one `DataService` instance, and two `LoggingService` instances.
* this leads also to the following behaviour of services provided in:
** `AppModule` : available application-wide
** `AppComponent` : available to all components, but not services
** `Component` : available to component and children (if any).
