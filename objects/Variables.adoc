==== scoping
`var a1` is scoped to the function body. +
`let a2` is scoped to the block. +
`a3` is has always global scope - event if declared within a function.

==== hoisting (hissen)
`var` is hoisted : initialized with `undefined` before the code is run. +
`let` is not hoisted : accessing before initialization `-> ReferenceError`.

==== global object property
At the top level, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object:

[source,js]
var foo = "Foo";  // globally scoped
let bar = "Bar"; // globally scoped
console.log(window.foo); // Foo
console.log(window.bar); // undefined
